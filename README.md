## Abstract

In this repository, basic examples of topics related to control and dynamic systems will be added. Examples such as Generalized Predictive Control for SISO systems, Generalized Predictive Control for MIMO systems, PID Control, Systems Identification, and more can be found. These examples will be programmed in Matlab or Python, and information will be added describing briefly what each example is about.
